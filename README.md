### DriverPass Business Requirement and System Design

* Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?

The project is for DriverPass, a client that specializes in helping students pass their driving tests by providing practice tests and online learning. The aim is to create a smooth online process for student drivers to practice for their tests and make reservations for classes. 

I succeeded in my UML diagrams, as they are easy to understand and showcase the functionality of the project well. I added sufficient details that cover most of the requirements needed to create DriverPass.

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the UML sequence diagram; I believe it needs more steps to be more thorough. I would include IF statements and LOOPS as they pertain to the overall system design.

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The interview notes provided valuable insights into the user's needs. I tried to understand the overarching goal of DriverPass and then interpreted each functionality as a means to achieve that goal. Considering the user's needs is important because the product we are developing belongs to the user. The user is our customer, and the priority is to ensure customer satisfaction.

* How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach my design by fully understanding what is being asked. This could involve talking to clients, managers, or any stakeholders. Next, I read documentation and research similar products that have been built. Afterward, I begin the design implementation by gathering requirements and using UML diagrams.
